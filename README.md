# Churn-rates

* Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks me to look into subscription churn rates. It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.

* The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide me with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels. 

* Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
