# Churn-rates

* Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks me to look into subscription churn rates. Itâ€™s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.

* The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide me with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels. 

* Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
